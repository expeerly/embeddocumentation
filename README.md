Version 1.2, 10th of October 2024

## 1. Options: Youtube or Mux
Expeerly offers 2 Video Embedding Solutions via [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) Embed Links or via [Mux](https://www.mux.com/).

## 2. Embedding with Youtube
### 2.1 Embedding a YouTube Video
To embed a YouTube video, use the iframe code.
```
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqG3JCNkb0I?si=bikBYWxuWUS6SWCu" 
        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; 
        encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```
### 2.2 Embed examples Youtube
Galaxus shows the expeerly video in their image carousel, check this [link to the Philips Avent Kit](https://www.galaxus.ch/fr/s10/product/philips-avent-kit-de-soins-pour-bebe-soin-corporel-bebe-36358432?ip=8720689021937)

Brack shows the expeerly video in their image carousel, check this [link to the Philips Avent Kit ](https://www.brack.ch/philips-avent-baby-pflegeset-petrol-1614829)

But ultimately you're free to add the above embed code on any part of our online shop or marketplace. We recommend the carousel or product description just next to images for best conversion impact.

## 3. Embedding with Mux
### 3.1 Embedding with Mux Streaming Links
Mux Stream provides scalable video hosting, ideal for large volumes. You can use either the .mp4 format for static video playback or the .m3u8 format for adaptive streaming.

For on-demand playback: 
```
https://stream.mux.com/q2EyUPCM0000k3QbfjLVTmEL5N6PDL701aovfWx7QByv84/high.mp4
```

For adaptive streaming (ideal for varying bandwidths):
```
https://stream.mux.com/q2EyUPCM0000k3QbfjLVTmEL5N6PDL701aovfWx7QByv84.m3u8
```

### 3.2 Embed examples Mux Streaming Links
#### MP4
Here is an example of a mux mp4 streaming link added to a website. It can be any website as all browsers are able to read mp4 formats and will trigger the native video controls.

Check our expeerly [corporate page](https://www.get.expeerly.com/) and scroll down to the Dyson customer quote. On this webflow page we just add a playback link `https://stream.mux.com/q2EyUPCM0000k3QbfjLVTmEL5N6PDL701aovfWx7QByv84/high.mp4` as above.

#### M3U8
For more freedom over video controls you can use the HLS (m3u8) URL in a player of your choice. See the documentation [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/play-your-videos#3-use-the-hls-url-in-a-player).


### 3.3 Embedding with Mux Developer SDK
For a more customizable experience, use the Mux Developer SDK and add to your online shop or marketplace. You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/mux-player-web).

### 3.4 Embed example Mux SDK
Here is an example link for the Trisa Raclette Tischgrill video and how we integrate the Mux Web Player on our own expeerly.com video player page.
```
https://www.expeerly.com/de/video-reviews/elektronik-gadgets/trisa/raclette-tischgrill-style-connect/100000469
```

As you can see, [subtitles](https://docs.mux.com/guides/add-subtitles-to-your-videos#showing-subtitles-by-default) and separate [audio tracks](https://docs.mux.com/guides/player-core-functionality#multi-track-audio-selector) in 4 languages are available and can be triggered. The 4 languages are English, German, French and Italian on which all our videos have subtitles provided by default. Those subtitles are always proofread by our team. AI dubbed Audio tracks are not yet available on existing videos, but we're planning to add them in early 2025.

We recommend embedding the videos to the carousel or product description just next to images for best conversion impact.

## 4. Matching Video Links with Products in your Catalogue
As of now all our retail partners get a spreadsheet where on each line the relevant products including GTIN and if required our partnerâ€™s own product number are indicated along the video links. Retailers then add the video links upon their descretion to their system. This works well for up to 100 videos a month.

See a spreadsheet example [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kXQ7DBHRILnurgFzuOjY3owplIlcU94W2a_1l2gwAxg/edit?usp=sharing).

We have a retail partner portal in the pipeline that will allow you to login to our [platform](https://app.expeerly.com) and see all the available videos there. We don't offer a public API at this stage, but if you're interested in using the API, please get in touch with us on [product@expeerly.com](mailto:product@expeerly.com).
