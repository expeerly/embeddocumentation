## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Integration Script

~Log into your Expeerly dashboard and copy your unique integration script. This script is pre-configured with your shop's identifier and necessary credentials.~ PENDING 

For the beta phase, get in touch with the expeerly team directly. The script is publicly available for now.

### Step 2: Add the Script to the Head Section
Add the following code snippet to your head section in your html code
```html
<script src="https://www.expeerly.com/expeerly.js"></script>
```

### Step 3: Add the Script to Your Product Pages

Add the script to your product page template just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<!-- This is an example. Get your actual script from the Expeerly dashboard -->
<script>
    expeerly()
</script>
```

### Step 4: Add the expeerly component to Your Product Pages
Add the experly html element(with the gtin/ean/upc as an attribute) where ever you want to have experely videos shown:
```html
<expeerly gtin="123456789012"></expeerly>
```

That's it! The Expeerly script will automatically:
- Check for available video reviews
- Add videos to your product carousel if available
- Create a review block with detailed information
- Add a summary button above the fold
- Handle all analytics tracking

## Customization

To globaly customize the appearance of the Expeerly integration, you can add optional data attributes to your script tag:

```html
<script>
    expeerly({accentColor: "#2C1277", locale: "en"})
</script>
```
Available configurations:
| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :---- | :--- |
| accentColor | any color like hex / rgba / hsl | set the accent color for the main color | undefined |
| locale | en / de / fr / it | for now we provide 4 languages, if there is no language we will use the html or browser defined language. If we don't provide the language we will use the default language | en |

To customize individual integrations you can add attributes to the expeerly html element:

```html
<expeerly data-type="badge" data-theme="dark" data-max="12"></expeerly>
```

Available data attributes:
| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| type | badge / carousel / reviewblock | select to show the data in the carousel, the button and/or as review block | reviewblock |
| theme | dark / light / miniminal | select the theme (background colour) | dark |
| max | number | how many reviews should be loaded | undefined |

## What the expeerly.js does
The script
- creates a video player from [mux](https://www.mux.com/) and streams the videos from the mux server.
- makes a request on the backend to get all important data for the reviews.
- replaces all expeerly html elements on the page with the carousel or the videos.

All styles are generated by the script and each class contains the prefix `expeerly`.
